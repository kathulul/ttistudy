What are some of your hobbies?

You said:
I like biking and playing video games in my free time

You said:
I'm more of a city biker but I won't say no for long rides out of the city. In terms of games, I'm currently playing [REDACTED] TCG on my phone

You said:
I collect cards for fun, right now I'm using a deck consisting of Giratina EX and Mewtwo EX, do you play at all?

You said:
I don't have too many right now as I'm starting fresh, but some of my best pulls have been [REDACTED] and Metwo Vstar

You said:
I'm hoping to open the new heat wave pack as Typhlosion is one of my favorite pokemon and it has a beautiful full art

You said:
Hunting mainly for Typhlosion classic, is there any card you're looking for?

You said:
Other than that, I just want some nice full arts that display the personality of pokemon or tell a story
