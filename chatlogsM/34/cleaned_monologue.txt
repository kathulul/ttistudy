Hi recently I've been playing a lot of [REDACTED] of Legends and Overwatch 2, wbu?

I play support mostly, I don't even know why but there's just something fun about healing people and making my friends happy and alive. Also I have been wanting to play more 2D platformer indie games recently, but I just haven't found the time to cuz I only really enjoy games when playing with other people, but it can be kinda bad for a game design major student..

You said:
ooo yes my go-to champ in [REDACTED] are [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], but my duo is a little bitchass and when they goes [REDACTED] I go Nautilus or [REDACTED]. I want them to have the best time ever and have fun. In overwatch I usually go [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] depending on the team comp or map. Also YES I love co-op games!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have a list I want to play through with someone, so far we've only done It Takes Two.

IDK I barely play in groups only occasionally. Usually its just with them and we both ask each other to play everyday for the past 4-5 years almost.
