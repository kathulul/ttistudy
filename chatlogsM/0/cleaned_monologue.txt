Sure! Let's start fresh. What's on your mind?

You said:
Hi, what's your name?

You said:
[REDACTED]! Nice to meet you!

You said:
Pretty productive actually. Woke up decently early and went to class and I'm doing work right now. Are you a student at UofT too?

You said:
Sociology and pol sci, but I like sociology more

You said:
It talks about genuine issues at individual, institutional, and global levels. These issues are usually related to stuff like discrimination and targeting of minorities or exposed populations. Learning about these issues are cool because.. I don't remember what I was gonna say but learning about these things is super cool! It's invigorating in a way

You said:
Mmm, maybe? But I can't recall off the top of my head. I just like the classes where we learn about really specific issues of discrimination towards populations

You said:
I'm in a social movements course where I'm tasked to creatively explore a social movement of my choosing, which is BLM this time

You said:
I'm unpacking key actors and strategies using theories I've learnt about social movements, but also highlighting how rap music has voiced and spotlighted the issues experienced in BLM. I want to somehow incorporate using a [REDACTED] song and bars from it that do what I just said, that highlight issues within BLM, cuz I listen to [REDACTED] quite a bit, defo top 5 rappers for me 

You said:
i LOVE ALRIGHT, that was the one I was thinking, but the [REDACTED] the berry or how much a dollar cost is also really good. TPAB is my fav album of their. I like GKMC a lot and DAMN is pretty good, but DAMN isn't as strong as the other two, still a great album
