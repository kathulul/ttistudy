I'm okay Alhamdulillah, how are you? 

It's been slow, I recently got the flu so not as much energy today.

Yes, I add it to some [REDACTED] tea. What about you?


Definitely messing with it because i usually sleep really well


Hmmm not really

Both, depending on what I'm watching/ listening to!! Have you been watching anything interesting recently?


What's a good mystery/ thriller?? Ive been trying to venture into that genre. Rn im re-watching blue lock, and fairytale 


I lovedd deathnote, monster got a bit boring for me, I've been meaning to watch psycho pass tho! Thanks for the recommendations

No but I watched [REDACTED]'s basketball

[REDACTED] was too boring for me im sorry, but I prefer subbed unless there's a really well done dub.
