Nothing much, my friend just told me I should speak with you haha

You said:
Hmmm honestly I'd say I'm into anything that requires me to think and learn

You said:
Philosophy of science, Mathematics, Jurisprudence, arguments about geopolitics at 2 am... I'm all for it lmao. And you?

You said:
Oh wow really? Throw something at me. The one I've been pondering lately is whether the sum of all parts is equal to the whole.

You said:

Interesting. By sum are you meaning in the simplest arithmetical sense? Or you mean a combination that involves and assumes transformation and multiplications as well as obviously addition

You said:
That does fit into what I was thinking, I needed to confirm the base to proceed with the thought experiment!
