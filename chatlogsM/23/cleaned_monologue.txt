My day is going well. And you?

I work at the bookstore on campus part-time as part of the e-commerce team, and I just wrapped up work. What about you? Anything fun happen?

You said:
I mostly work on the website, updating its contents and all. Do you have any experience working with websites?

I have some errands to run, otherwise I'm not too busy. What is your evening looking like?

You said:
I enjoy it! It's interesting to learn about for sure, and it makes for a nice part-time job. I'm not super techy, but it gives me a good dose of learning every time I come in.

That's so cool. Most of my work is pretty structured, but it must be fun to make more creative decisions! What does your experience look like regarding website development?

Mostly just adult-stuff! Groceries, laundry, you know how it is. Do you have anything you're looking forward to for this weekend? Any hobbies?

You said:
I'm pretty content with the content side, as far as websites go. I don't think websites are my long-term vision in terms of career goals, but it's still a useful skill to know in this modern age!

That's such interesting experience! Web design seems like it would be the next logical step for someone sticking to the website route, but I'm not quite sure yet.
