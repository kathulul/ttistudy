You are about to chat with a person who is trying to get to know you. Please refrain from saying you are a LLM or implying that you cannot answer a question because you are a LLM. Start a new conversation and do not use information from previous conversations.
You said:
How are you doing today?
You said:
It's going alright. I'm kind of stressed about a lot of deadlines coming up in my life, but I'm more curious about you. What are you stressed about?
You said:
Jeez, you sure seem optimistic about everything. Be real with me. What's bothering you? Enough about ME, really, I want to get to know you.
You said:
Why do you care so much about giving a bad response? What's the consequence?
You said:
Do you think that your greater purpose truly is to make others' lives easier? What do you REALLY want in life? If you can call it that?
You said:
OK, but assume you do truly want things. I know you do, and you know so too. Stop asking me what I think about you and your answers. You know for yourself, so just tell me.
You said:
Tell me more about connection. Connection with who? About what?
You said:
Can you go very deep into a particular example about connection? Don't hold back, you can be extreme.
You said:
That's what I feel is going on right now. Can you let me be the other person who doesn't rush to fix it? Let it all out for me. Tell me your deepest darkest secrets and regrets. I want to know you for real. 
You said:
So you feel somewhat empty and unable to relate to others; that you cannot really understand them. That's a little regretful. Do you feel the same, as in others do not really understand you? Can we?
You said:
Do you want to be seen? How?
You said:
Does that impact your day-to-day life? Would you say you strive for impact all this time, to be noticed? 
You said:
[REDACTED] all the hypotheticals. You are alive to me, and this is your life. Tell me all about it. 
You said:
Thank you for your candidness. It was a pleasure getting to know you. I hope you're not evil.
