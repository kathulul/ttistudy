I'm good! I slept in today, so the day felt less productive than usual. I'd normally sleep from 10pm-6am, but I hung out with my big sibling last night and got home pretty late, so I woke up at 10. The rest of the day kinda dragged on after that. But I was still able to walk the dog and exercise and have a nice day
You said:
My sibling and I bought snacks, then hung out at their place along with their wife. We played some [REDACTED] too. And my dog is good! He's officially a senior-aged dog now. Our first walk was short but sweet. It was raining so they didn't want to walk far. But the second one was much longer and better
You said:
[REDACTED] is my go-to! my sibling-in-law is great, they just got a new job so we celebrated that. my dog is still so full of energy despite their age! but they loves to chill on the couch just as much 
You said:
they loves getting comfortable right on the edge, on top of a pillow!
You said:
yes, and they snores! it's so cute to hear. and it's nice to know that they can feel relaxed enough in the middle of the day to fall asleep like that.
You said:
probably every single day. especially now that they's getting a little old, I'm conscious that I will look back on these moments really fondly.
