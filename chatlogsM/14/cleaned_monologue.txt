[REDACTED] what's up, not much, what about you?

You said:
I've been a little busy with school and my sleep schedule is pretty fucked but hey, I'm going out this weekend so at least I get to enjoy life for a little.

You said:
My friends host this party like once every two weeks and there's one tomorrow on Friday, so I will be there.

You said:
Well, it's a [REDACTED] party. We do tend to have a little more fun in these hahahaha.

You said:
It's a pure reggaeton party. The DJs are also my friends, the owners of the event.

You said:
Damn, I requested [REDACTED] by [REDACTED] with [REDACTED]. They told me they were going to play it, so I'm pretty excited.

You said:
Definitely dancing and singing. That's all we do.

You said:
In [REDACTED] culture there's not really like "dance moves" per se. We just sort of sing and do what flows properly.

You said:
You get it, I bet you'd have fun.

You said:
I'm sure I will, it's always a blast at my friends' parties.

You said:
Sure will.
