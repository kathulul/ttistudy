Pretty boring I watched a couple of lectures for school but thats a bout it nothing extremely interesting

You said:
The prof is pretty good and teaches really well. its better than most lectures since theyre pretty boring and monotomous

You said:
they're just really straight forward the theory and then example of how to use the theory and repeat. Just straight up handson stuff

You said:
Well I'm currently studying computer science which is a pretty math heavy major. I do prefer math over essays tho. Im not really set on my future maybe something related to software developing and stuff like that but I also want to do many things in the future

I would love to travel and become a travel vlogger type person. I think that would be really cool making money while traveling. Not staying in one place 

You said:
I would like to go back to [REDACTED] as well as [REDACTED] like my family is doing this summer but I'm not able to because i'm working for the summer term. WHat about you?

You said:
Porbably a  bit of both. Places where family is to visit them, and new places! I would love to go check out [REDACTED]. I love the cyberpunk city vibes it has
