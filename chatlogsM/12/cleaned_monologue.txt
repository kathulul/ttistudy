You said:
not bad, how are you

You said:
i think id say going to a club social with my friends, we had food and listened to club election speeches

You said:
the speeches were all right, but honestly im not even part of the club so i was just accompanying some friends and mostly there for the food

You said:
just pizza and soda but it was all right since i didnt have to pay

You said:
oh my friends do take it seriously, its a club more related to their programs and interests

You said:
id consider it, but primarily because i know people, and since the people i know are graduating i have less incentive to join id say

You said:
Id say im mostly a free agent, ive participated in some clubs but honestly never felt too attached to them, the main thing id say i really liked being part of was my intramural soccer team

You said:
i used to play competitively, but now im part of the school's coed recreational league, which is much more chill

You said:
i do miss the competitive side, as we'd take it much more seriously, with tactics and everything. also the skill disparities in my current team make it more difficult to coordinate everything properly

You said:
i think ill be sticking with casual for now since its really accessible to me through the school, but maybe some day ill try competitve again
