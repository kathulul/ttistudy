Hey, how's it going?

You said:
I've been better, exam season is going on right now which is rough

You said:
Feeling pretty indifferent, just going to go through the motions and enjoy the last month

You said:
Going to move back home, spend some time with my family and relax

You said:
Home cooked meals, seeing my family on a daily basis again and having the time to go hit the gym and take some music production lessons

You said:
I've been making music for a couple years now, only really diving into production specifically recently

You said:
Not sure yet, dabbling with a bunch of genres like pop-rock and hyperpop mostly. I'm looking forward to learning how to make my mixes professional and how to get a better workflow for being consistent with my software

You said:
I'm using ableton right now

You said:
I've barely touched stock plugins other than granulator and the built in samplers, 95% of the plugins I use on my tracks are third party

You said:
[REDACTED] has been awesome for me lately, other than that I use ozone's equalizer, ott, spitfire labs, serum and [REDACTED] a good bit
