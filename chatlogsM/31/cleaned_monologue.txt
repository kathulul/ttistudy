hmm not much other than school and work! but i learned a new opener in tetris it's called stick spin 

You said:
thank you! and it's more of a setup play, it requires the green z piece to come after the yellow square piece or for you to hold it that way then you can setup to perform a t-spin into a t-spin into a t-d spin into another t spin in the first four batches 

You said:
yeaa but i'm kind of slow at it still, i think it's more of a pvp strategy. i soft drop too long i think i should set this up mid game instead 

You said:
