Hi nice to meet you too! My [REDACTED] are watching tv shows, listening to music, fashion and beauty. My current favourite tv show is this [REDACTED] drama called [REDACTED]. I love the characters and the development they go through in this drama. 
What are some of your [REDACTED] and interests?

You said:
Omg yes! I love that me too. It's so much fun curating a Pinterest board of certain aesthetics I wanna try to incorporate into my fashion. Same with music, I cannot go a day without listening to music. It's a great mood booster.

You said:
Yep, I usually try to match my music to my current mood or emotion. Or I would put on songs to uplift myself if I am feeling down or just need a quick pick me up. Recently I've been listening to a lot of edm, like [REDACTED], [REDACTED], etc.
