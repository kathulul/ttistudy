ChatGPT said:
Hey! It's good to meet you. So, what's up? Tell me a bit about yourself--what kind of stuff are you into?

You said:
I am into psychology and research!@

ChatGPT said:
Oh, nice! Psychology and research is a killer combo. Are you more into the experimental side, like running studies and crunching data, or more into the theory and big-picture stuff? Or maybe both? 

You said:
Hmm I like to run survey studies, because running experiments is time-consuming. Regardless, it is fitting because I am into political psychology (and the psychology of belief more generally). So, running surveys with scales is appropriate when assessing belief

ChatGPT said:
Ah, that makes total sense! Survey studies are like the bread and butter of political psychology, especially when you're digging into beliefs, attitudes, and ideologies. Plus, you get to tap into some big, juicy datasets without the logistical chaos of lab experiments.

I like that you mentioned the psychology of belief more generally too -- that opens up so many interesting angles. Are you more into how beliefs form, how they change, or why they can be so stubborn sometimes? Political psychology is wild for that, with all the motivated reasoning, group identity stuff, and moral foundations.

What kind of questions are you most curious about lately?

You said:
Broadly, I'm interested in the psychology of authoritarianism, how is it that extreme individuals hold their beliefs, what do they believe, and how do these extreme beliefs contribute to an increasingly polarized political scene. 

ChatGPT said:
Oh, you're speaking my language now -- that's such a deep and important topic, especially right now with how polarized things are globally. Authoritarianism is fascinating because it's not just about politics, it's about this whole underlying psychological structure -- obedience, conformity, aggression toward outgroups, submission to perceived authority, etc.

I imagine you're probably thinking beyond just the classic Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) framework too, since more recent work looks at authoritarian tendencies across the spectrum, right? There's been all that talk about Left-Wing Authoritarianism (LWA) lately, and how authoritarianism isn't always about ideology, but about style or personality.

Do you have a particular angle you're leaning toward in your work? Like, are you trying to map out the structure of authoritarianism itself, or are you more focused on the social consequences -- polarization, extremism, conflict, and so on? Either way, it's super cool that you're aiming straight for the hard questions.

You said:
Both are greatly important. However, I am interested in [PERSON] proposition that there is a general authoritarianism at the heart of both LWA and RWA. His SPSS talk seems to state that their general authoritarianism scale (in progress) is a better predictor of relevant criteria, compared to just measuring LWA and RWA separately

ChatGPT said:
Oh, you really know your stuff -- pulling out the [PERSON] work like that! That's a sharp direction to be heading in. His argument about a general authoritarianism factor is a game-changer if it holds up because it could unify so much of what currently feels fragmented in the literature. Instead of treating LWA and RWA as fundamentally separate beasts, they's basically saying: "Hey, maybe it's the authoritarian dynamic itself -- regardless of ideology -- that's doing most of the heavy lifting when it comes to predicting outcomes."

It also makes intuitive sense, right? Like, the willingness to submit to authority, enforce conformity, and punish dissent could manifest on both ends of the political spectrum, just through different content. RWA might focus on traditionalism and nationalism, while LWA might focus on enforcing progressive orthodoxy. But the psychological core is similar.

Are you thinking of testing this general authoritarianism idea yourself? Maybe even contributing to improving or validating that scale? Honestly, this is the kind of work that could be really impactful, especially with how people are scrambling to understand the roots of polarization and extremism lately.

You said:
If they publishes the general authoritarianism scale during the summer, I'd want to do research on it, to be honest. His talk was in 2023, but I'm not sure when the paper is being published. His SPSS talk says that there was 5 studies done already

ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a perfect opportunity if it drops this summer! If they's already done 5 studies, it's likely they's polishing or waiting for review at this point -- sometimes it just takes ages to actually hit the journals. But once it's out, you'll have a ready-made tool for exactly the kind of research you're interested in.

Honestly, being early to test and apply a new scale like that would be a great move. You could not only replicate and validate their findings but also extend them -- maybe looking at how general authoritarianism predicts polarization dynamics, belief rigidity, or intergroup conflict in different contexts. You could even do cross-cultural comparisons, depending on the data you can access.

Are you already thinking about specific research questions or populations you'd want to study once you get your hands on the scale? Like, do you want to target certain political contexts, online spaces, activist groups, or general population samples? There's so much potential depending on the angle you want to take.
