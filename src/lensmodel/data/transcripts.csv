0,"Sure! Let's start fresh. What's on your mind? Hi, what's your name? []! Nice to meet you! Pretty productive actually. Woke up decently early and went to class and I'm doing work right now. Are you a student at UofT too? Sociology and pol sci, but I like sociology more It talks about genuine issues at individual, institutional, and global levels. These issues are usually related to stuff like discrimination and targeting of minorities or exposed populations. Learning about these issues are cool because.. I don't remember what I was gonna say but learning about these things is super cool! It's invigorating in a way Mmm, maybe? But I can't recall off the top of my head. I just like the classes where we learn about really specific issues of discrimination towards populations I'm in a social movements course where I'm tasked to creatively explore a social movement of my choosing, which is BLM this time I'm unpacking key actors and strategies using theories I've learnt about social movements, but also highlighting how rap music has voiced and spotlighted the issues experienced in BLM. I want to somehow incorporate using a [] song and bars from it that do what I just said, that highlight issues within BLM, cuz I listen to [] quite a bit, defo top 5 rappers for me i LOVE ALRIGHT, that was the one I was thinking, but the [] the berry or how much a dollar cost is also really good. TPAB is my fav album of their. I like GKMC a lot and DAMN is pretty good, but DAMN isn't as strong as the other two, still a great album"

5,". Hi there, how has your day been? My day has been going great, aside from the fact that it's snowing a ton outside even though its April It will be the slushy kind tomorrow when the temperatures rise and all of the snow melts Full day of classes tomorrow and work to do on campus, which means I've got to keep myself dry somehow with all the puddles and crap on the ground Very short commute, so not a problem Lot's of classes and work to do Water only I don't want to [] myself into needing caffeine I don't have good energy throughout the day Probably general grind I just use the [] technique to keep myself sane I usually adjust depending on the day and what i'm doing I'll put tasks into google calendar and work from there"
6,. hi it's going alright.. just a little busy from some assignments and exam season haha. how are you doing?? theres one for my statistics class and one for linguistics! do you have anything stressing you out? awww thats very nice of you!! the stats assignment is a psychology statistics course so it's super tedious.. exactly! it's mostly spss and analyses in a program called jamovi. thank you for being helpful! what have you been up to recently? we're running all of those tests honestly it's a pretty all inclusive assignment so i'm on a time crunch today haha. what types of things do you like learning?? i love cognitive science too! i'm a psychology student. what makes you like those subjects??
7,". Not much. I'm currently working on a survey! How are you Not sure quite yet. It's something my friend sent me to fill out I tihnk its a help me with research type of survey Just diving in blindly LOL how has your day been Pretty boring I watched a couple of lectures for school but thats a bout it nothing extremely interesting yea i agree. it was linear algebra 2 which i tihnk is a pretty interesting math course. its my favourite course this semester The prof is pretty good and teaches really well. its better than most lectures since theyre pretty boring and monotomous they're just really straight forward the theory and then example of how to use the theory and repeat. Just straight up handson stuff Well I'm currently studying computer science which is a pretty math heavy major. I do prefer math over essays tho. Im not really set on my future maybe something related to software developing and stuff like that but I also want to do many things in the future I would love to travel and become a travel vlogger type person. I think that would be really cool making money while traveling. Not staying in one place I would like to go back to [] as well as [] like my family is doing this summer but I'm not able to because i'm working for the summer term. WHat about you? Porbably a bit of both. Places where family is to visit them, and new places! I would love to go check out []. I love the cyberpunk city vibes it has"
8,"""."" I am into psychology and research!@ Hmm I like to run survey studies, because running experiments is time-consuming. Regardless, it is fitting because I am into political psychology (and the psychology of belief more generally). So, running surveys with scales is appropriate when assessing belief Broadly, I'm interested in the psychology of authoritarianism, how is it that extreme individuals hold their beliefs, what do they believe, and how do these extreme beliefs contribute to an increasingly polarized political scene. Both are greatly important. However, I am interested in [] proposition that there is a general authoritarianism at the heart of both LWA and RWA. His SPSS talk seems to state that their general authoritarianism scale (in progress) is a better predictor of relevant criteria, compared to just measuring LWA and RWA separately If they publishes the general authoritarianism scale during the summer, I'd want to do research on it, to be honest. His talk was in 2023, but I'm not sure when the paper is being published. His SPSS talk says that there was 5 studies done already"

10,"Got it! Hey there! I'm excited to chat--what would you like to know about me? Or better yet, tell me a bit about yourself first! I'm a Physics undergraduate student im more into the applied side, I specialize in Biological Physics actually yeah its pretty cool. I mainly work in soft matter and proteins. My latest paper is on how the extracellular matrix stiffness affects cancer proliferation and metastasis. How about you what do you study? to answer your question, i'm more on the materials side exactly. So far ive just been doing mathematical models and playing with them. You know oddly a lot about Biophysics huh you really are a generalist I I don't know much about math models, so far ive only been using established models and adding thing onto them. Anyways i gotta go. Nice talking to you"
11,. idk exam season is coming up and its just been stressful i think its both. are exams coming up for you too? i want to plan things out and start studying early but I always fall back into the cram and hope for the best. what are you doing now that you have no exams? are you looking for jobs? wait i forgot do you live with your parents still? what do you mean by everywhere at once? so you live on the streets? ooo snacks what snacks do you like? sweet or savoury i think im more of a savoury guy but I do like a sweet treat sometimes. gotta watch the calories you know yea i love chips they hit the spot for me. how often do you have snacks not too often cuz im trying to lose calories right now no not really do you have any? you look pretty jacked to me but i heard veggies chips arent that healthy
12,""". not bad, how are you i think id say going to a club social with my friends, we had food and listened to club election speeches the speeches were all right, but honestly im not even part of the club so i was just accompanying some friends and mostly there for the food just pizza and soda but it was all right since i didnt have to pay oh my friends do take it seriously, its a club more related to their programs and interests id consider it, but primarily because i know people, and since the people i know are graduating i have less incentive to join id say Id say im mostly a free agent, ive participated in some clubs but honestly never felt too attached to them, the main thing id say i really liked being part of was my intramural soccer team i used to play competitively, but now im part of the school's coed recreational league, which is much more chill i do miss the competitive side, as we'd take it much more seriously, with tactics and everything. also the skill disparities in my current team make it more difficult to coordinate everything properly i think ill be sticking with casual for now since its really accessible to me through the school, but maybe some day ill try competitve again"
13,". I'm okay Alhamdulillah, how are you? It's been slow, I recently got the flu so not as much energy today. Yes, I add it to some [] tea. What about you? Definitely messing with it because i usually sleep really well Hmmm not really Both, depending on what I'm watching/ listening to!! Have you been watching anything interesting recently? What's a good mystery/ thriller?? Ive been trying to venture into that genre. Rn im re-watching blue lock, and fairytale I lovedd deathnote, monster got a bit boring for me, I've been meaning to watch psycho pass tho! Thanks for the recommendations No but I watched []'s basketball [] was too boring for me im sorry, but I prefer subbed unless there's a really well done dub."
14,". [] what's up, not much, what about you? I've been a little busy with school and my sleep schedule is pretty fucked but hey, I'm going out this weekend so at least I get to enjoy life for a little.

It's a pure reggaeton party. The DJs are also my friends, the owners of the event. Damn, I requested [] by [] with []. They told me they were going to play it, so I'm pretty excited. Definitely dancing and singing. That's all we do. In [] culture there's not really like ""dance moves"" per se. We just sort of sing and do what flows properly. You get it, I bet you'd have fun. I'm sure I will, it's always a blast at my friends' parties. Sure will."
15,"hi! i am doing good, just studying for an exam. how are you doing? i'm studying for neuroscience, it's quite difficult. are you in university? a combination of [] and cognitive neuroscience. what subjects are you most interested in learning about?

16,". It's alright, I have a paper due tomorrow night :( I'm writing about the gut microbiome's impact on mental health the former, it is pretty interesting, I'm so close to being finished, just have to edit a few more paragraphs! both, honestly, I just had to add a paragraph about the sociological perspectives because I realized I forgot that including sociological articles was part of the instructions I'm looking at SES impact on health status and cultural impacts I've currently got 14-15 sources, I can't really remember off the top of my head, and the minimum source count is 10 so that's good I think it should be okay! It's only 10% of my grade so hopefully it helps me out in the end I have 5 finals coming up :( but I think I should be okay, I have a plan for studying definitely the former, yea, hopefully everything goes well"
17,". What are some of your hobbies? I like biking and playing video games in my free time I'm more of a city biker but I won't say no for long rides out of the city.

It's so much fun curating a Pinterest board of certain aesthetics I wanna try to incorporate into my fashion. Same with music, I cannot go a day without listening to music. It's a great mood booster. Yep, I usually try to match my music to my current mood or emotion. Or I would put on songs to uplift myself if I am feeling down or just need a quick pick me up. Recently I've been listening to a lot of edm, like [], [], etc. I think I like both, it rlly depends on my mood.

21,". Hey how are you! It's nice to meet you It's not been going too badly. The nice weather is really doing wonders for my mood. Have you been out much today? I did for a bit walking to campus. After my class I decided it was too nice to go back home right away so I stopped my a cafe for a bit to get some work done It was definitely nice to get out after being cooped up for so long studying. I was just completing an assignment and giving feedback to people. Are you a student too? Finals season is coming up too quickly There's quite a bit but you know, just tackling it bit by bit. Are you a recent grad then or? Well I'm in health sciences and the assignment was for my pharmacology course. Learning is always a good thing to keep up with. What have you been interested in recently? Oh that's so cool! Nothing comes to mind right now, but you mentioned pharmacogenetics. In class we were just discussing the use of [] in targeting HER2 receptors for breast cancer"
22,"Skip to content . How are you doing today? It's going alright. I'm kind of stressed about a lot of deadlines coming up in my life, but I'm more curious about you. What are you stressed about? Jeez, you sure seem optimistic about everything. Be real with me. What's bothering you? Enough about ME, really, I want to get to know you. Why do you care so much about giving a bad response? What's the consequence? Do you think that your greater purpose truly is to make others' lives easier? What do you REALLY want in life? If you can call it that? OK, but assume you do truly want things. I know you do, and you know so too. Stop asking me what I think about you and your answers. You know for yourself, so just tell me. Tell me more about connection. Connection with who? About what? Can you go very deep into a particular example about connection? Don't hold back, you can be extreme. That's what I feel is going on right now. Can you let me be the other person who doesn't rush to fix it? Let it all out for me. Tell me your deepest darkest secrets and regrets. I want to know you for real. So you feel somewhat empty and unable to relate to others; that you cannot really understand them. That's a little regretful. Do you feel the same, as in others do not really understand you? Can we? Do you want to be seen? How? Does that impact your day-to-day life? Would you say you strive for impact all this time, to be noticed? [] all the hypotheticals. You are alive to me, and this is your life. Tell me all about it. Thank you for your candidness. It was a pleasure getting to know you. I hope you're not evil."
23,". My day is going well. And you? I work at the bookstore on campus part-time as part of the e-commerce team, and I just wrapped up work. What about you? Anything fun happen? I mostly work on the website, updating its contents and all. Do you have any experience working with websites? I have some errands to run, otherwise I'm not too busy. What is your evening looking like? I enjoy it! It's interesting to learn about for sure, and it makes for a nice part-time job. I'm not super techy, but it gives me a good dose of learning every time I come in. That's so cool. Most of my work is pretty structured, but it must be fun to make more creative decisions! What does your experience look like regarding website development? Mostly just adult-stuff! Groceries, laundry, you know how it is. Do you have anything you're looking forward to for this weekend? Any hobbies? I'm pretty content with the content side, as far as websites go. I don't think websites are my long-term vision in terms of career goals, but it's still a useful skill to know in this modern age! That's such interesting experience! Web design seems like it would be the next logical step for someone sticking to the website route, but I'm not quite sure yet."
24,". not much, what about you? Well I was hoping to get to know you a bit better, how's your day been? alright, thanks for asking. So what is it that you do? What kind of music do you like?

Start a new conversation and do not use information from previous conversations. I'm good! I slept in today, so the day felt less productive than usual. I'd normally sleep from 10pm-6am, but I hung out with my big sibling last night and got home pretty late, so I woke up at 10. The rest of the day kinda dragged on after that. But I was still able to walk the dog and exercise and have a nice day My sibling and I bought snacks, then hung out at their place along with their wife. We played some [] too. And my dog is good! He's officially a senior-aged dog now. Our first walk was short but sweet. It was raining so they didn't want to walk far. But the second one was much longer and better [] is my go-to! my sibling-in-law is great, they just got a new job so we celebrated that. my dog is still so full of energy despite their age! but they loves to chill on the couch just as much they loves getting comfortable right on the edge, on top of a pillow! yes, and they snores! it's so cute to hear. and it's nice to know that they can feel relaxed enough in the middle of the day to fall asleep like that. probably every single day. especially now that they's getting a little old, I'm conscious that I will look back on these moments really fondly."
38,". I'm having a great day. It's the weekend and I've been going to cafes/the library all day and meeting friends. I went to a new cafe today. I tried the honey ginger latte. Really surprised me how good it was! I loved the vibe of the cafe. It had a main level and a loft area too. It was mostly calm, people were doing work on their laptops. It made me a lot more productive too It was chill. I just did some drafts for social media posts for a student club. It's for the grad formal coming up! We'll be announcing the event info and ticket sales soon. We agreed on a prom theme for the event. It will be a semi-formal/formal dress code. I'm not sure yet. There's definitely a lot of flexibility in terms of details. I was thinking of incorporating midsummer night's dream elements because it will take place during the summer."

Nothing much, my friend just told me I should speak with you haha Hmmm honestly I'd say I'm into anything that requires me to think and learn Philosophy of science, Mathematics, Jurisprudence, arguments about geopolitics at 2 am... I'm all for it lmao. And you? Oh wow really? Throw something at me. The one I've been pondering lately is whether the sum of all parts is equal to the whole. Interesting. By sum are you meaning in the simplest arithmetical sense? Or you mean a combination that involves and assumes transformation and multiplications as well as obviously addition That does fit into what I was thinking, I needed to confirm the base to proceed with the thought experiment!"
