Hey there! 😊 What’s something fun or random you’ve been into lately?







You said:
Hi recently I've been playing a lot of League of Legends and Overwatch 2, wbu?


ChatGPT said:
Nice, both are super intense but so fun in different ways. What roles do you usually play in League and Overwatch?

As for me, I’ve been diving into indie games lately—stuff with cozy vibes or unique art styles. Also been getting into game lore videos way too much. 😂







You said:
I play support mostly, I don't even know why but there's just something fun about healing people and making my friends happy and alive. Also I have been wanting to play more 2D platformer indie games recently, but I just haven't found the time to cuz I only really enjoy games when playing with other people, but it can be kinda bad for a game design major student..


ChatGPT said:
That’s actually super wholesome—keeping your team alive and happy is underrated hero energy. 💚 Support players really shape the vibe of the match, even if they don’t always get the glory. Do you have a go-to champ in League or a support hero you love in Overwatch?

And I feel you on the solo game struggle. It’s wild how being into game design doesn’t always mean you enjoy playing everything solo. There's a big difference between appreciating mechanics and actually being immersed, especially if you're a social gamer at heart. Maybe couch co-op style platformers could bridge the gap a bit? Stuff like Cuphead, Unravel Two, or Celeste (with mods or backseat co-op) might scratch that itch while still keeping that “together” energy.

Out of curiosity, is your interest in game design more art-focused, system/mechanics-driven, or something else entirely?







You said:
ooo yes my go-to champ in League are Nami and Lulu, but my duo is a little bitchass and when she goes Samira I go Nautilus or Leona. I want her to have the best time ever and have fun. In overwatch I usually go Juno Mercy or Kiriko depending on the team comp or map. Also YES I love co-op games!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have a list I want to play through with someone, so far we've only done It Takes Two. 



2/2

LMAO “bitchass” duo—love that energy. That’s real friendship, sacrificing your bubbly Nami waves and sparkly Lulu shields for a meaty Naut hook just so she can dash into the entire enemy team like a menace. 😂 That’s beautiful.

Also It Takes Two is such a good start!! That game legit raised the bar for co-op design. What else is on your co-op bucket list? I’m guessing titles like A Way Out, We Were Here, Unravel Two, maybe even Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime?

And Juno Mercy?? So you’re not just healing—you’re serving. Kiriko too though?? The flicks AND the teleports?? You’re carrying in spirit, style, and stats.

I gotta ask: are you the “planner” in your friend group when it comes to game nights and co-op stuff, or the “just tell me when and I’m there” type?







You said:
IDK I barely play in groups only occasionally. Usually its just with her and we both ask each other to play everyday for the past 4-5 years almost.


ChatGPT said:
Aww that’s actually so sweet?? That kind of consistent, everyday duo bond is rare and chef’s kiss precious. You two basically grew up together in the trenches of ranked games, huh? 😭 The way y’all have that “telepathic synergy” where you don’t even have to ping anymore—you just know.

Honestly, that kind of connection makes games way more meaningful. It's not even just about the mechanics or wins, but the comfort of knowing someone’s always down to queue up and laugh (or tilt) with you.

Have you two ever thought about playing something more narrative-heavy together? Like Life is Strange: True Colors, or The Quarry, or even Divinity: Original Sin 2? Some of those games are low-key emotional bonding tests too. 😭 Or do y’all mostly stick to fast-paced, competitive stuff?

EW RANKED IS FOR LOSERS and no we havent tried those yet next on the list is Split fiction but her laptop sucks and couldnt open it cuz of some driver issues


ChatGPT said:
HAHA OKAY fair fair, ranked is the fast track to pain and broken keyboards. Y’all are just here for a good time, not a mental breakdown—respect. 🙌

And oooh Split/Screen Fiction—that’s such an intriguing pick. It’s so stylish too, kinda gives that artsy, experimental feel. Shame about the laptop struggles though… those driver issues hit harder than a fed Yasuo. 😔

If you’re waiting on tech stuff to get sorted, maybe some lighter, browser-friendly co-ops could fill the gap? Stuff like Sky: Children of the Light, or even chaotic stuff like Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. Or do you two just go back to League/Overwatch whenever plans fall through?

Also, totally random—but if someone made a co-op game about your friendship, what would it look like? 👀
